1,T Cell,"The top 20 marker genes include IL7R, CCL19, CD2, CCR7, ITK, TRBC2, GZMK, CD3E, FCN1, CD40LG, TRAC, CTLA4, SELL, FOXP3, CD163, GIMAP7, TIGIT, CD4, CXCR4, CCL5. These genes suggest a T-cell profile, which aligns well with the candidates 'T cells' and 'T helper cells'. Additionally, the presence of CD3E and CD4 further supports the classification as T cells. The absence of markers for other specific cell types like B cells, NK cells, or monocytes does not provide strong evidence against T cells.","IL7R, CCL19, CD2, CCR7, ITK, TRBC2, GZMK, CD3E, FCN1, CD40LG, TRAC, CTLA4, SELL, FOXP3, CD163, GIMAP7, TIGIT, CD4, CXCR4, CCL5"

These genes are predominantly associated with epithelial cells, fibroblasts/stroma, and immune cells. The presence of genes like ITGB6, which is commonly expressed in platelets but also found in epithelial cells, further supports the epithelial nature. Additionally, the absence of specific liver-specific genes like FGA, FGB, FGG, ALB, CYP suggests it's not a hepatocyte. Given the lack of strong evidence for any other specific cell types listed in Candidates, the most appropriate classification remains ambiguous.","ITGB6, KRT17, LCN2, MLPH, CTTNBP2, CTNND2, CXCL1, TACSTD2, DEFB1, AGR2, TSPAN13, KIF26B, ANXA13, RARRES1, TMC5, FGG, UGT1A1, RERG, CXCL3, SNAP25"

The presence of genes like CYP8B1 and FABP5 further supports the potential for hepatic stellate cells. Given the candidates provided, which includes 'Adipocytes' and 'Dendritic cells', it seems most likely that the cell type belongs to adipocytes or dendritic cells. However, considering the specific combination of genes and the context of liver biology, the most appropriate classification would be 'Hepatocyte'. This choice aligns well with the known functions and gene expression profiles of hepatocytes in liver tissue.","ADH4, SULT2A1, ARG1, SERPINC1, HAMP, AHSG, AGXT, CYP8B1, SERPINA11, AFM, HAO2, SPP2, HAO1, PCK1, ADH1A, ALDOB, APOF, F13B, F2, ITIH1"

The presence of genes such as ANXA13, which is commonly found in epithelial cells, further supports this classification. Additionally, the absence of strong tumor-specific markers like CD3D, CD3E, CD4, CD8, TRAC suggests it is not a cancer cell or cholangiocyte subtype.

These genes are primarily associated with neuronal differentiation, lipid metabolism, and immune response. The presence of genes like NCAM1, which is known for neural crest development, further supports the labeling as Neuron.
